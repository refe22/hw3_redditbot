<addr> My favorite thing about this thread is that is shows how my bot was able to use polarity from textblob to discern which posts to upvote or down vote. 

## How Much Did this Bot Post:
<addr> The csci040bot posted ___ comments (according to the count below). Before, I had around 200 valid comments but when I checked my new number of comments, it went back down. I am not sure why this happened and I have tried to find where the error was in my code, but couldn't find it.

<addr> Since I completed tasks 0 - 5 and did two extra credit tasks worth 1 point (sorted comments_without_replies and upvoting comments that mention one of the candidates), and one extra credit task worth 2 points (using polarity to determine if the bot will up vote or down vote a comment), my score should be 20/20.
