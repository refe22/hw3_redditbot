<addr> Since I completed tasks 0 - 5 and did two extra credit tasks worth 1 point (sorted comments_without_replies and upvoting comments that mention one of the candidates), and one extra credit task worth 2 points (using polarity to determine if the bot will up vote or down vote a comment), my score should be 20/20.
